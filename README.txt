V.1.0

Hello Git and Github, my name is JP Clavijo, and it is a pleasure to be here.
Getting started with learning the basics. I'll upload this README.txt
every now and then to talk about my progress as a code scientist.

V.1.1

I'm starting to learn the basics of Git, Github, bash command line, and Python.
Getting pumped into learning code. No stuck moments till now!
