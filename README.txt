V.1.0

Hello Git and Github, my name is JP Clavijo, and it is a pleasure to be here.
Getting started with learning the basics. I'll upload this README.txt
every now and then to talk about my progress as a code scientist.

V.1.1

I'm starting to learn the basics of Git, Github, bash command line, and Python.
Getting pumped into learning code. No stuck moments till now!

V.1.2

Learning how to code and practicing Python. I'm actually uploading Python scripts
and uploading commits to a practice branch before merging them to the master branch.
